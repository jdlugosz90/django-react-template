# django-allauth branch

Builds on the default template by integrating django-allauth

# react-login branch 

    Builds off django-allauth branch to include a signup page.
    Currently it has basic functionality but is incomplete.
    Login, Register & logot work but lack form checking and user feedback (hard to implent with django-allauth. Would be great if using ONLY django for entire site)
